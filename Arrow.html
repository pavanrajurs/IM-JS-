    //Arrow functions in JavaScript are a cleaner and shorter way to write functions. They were introduced in ES6 and are often used for concise function expressions.

    //syntax : 
    const funcName = (param1, param2) => {
      return something;
    };

    //If the function is one-liner, with a single return, you can ditch the {} and return.
    const square = x => x * x;

    // Step 3: Zero Parameters?
    const sayHi = () => console.log("Hi there ðŸ‘‹");

    // Step 4: One Parameter?
    const double = n => n * 2;

    //  Step 5: Multiple Parameters?
    const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
    console.log(multiply(2, 3));

    // Step 6: Multi-line Function? Now we bring back the {} and return keyword. If you open the block, you have to explicitly return.
    const greet = name => {
      const message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
      return message;
    };
    console.log(greet("raj"));

    // Step 7: THIS is Different Arrow functions donâ€™t have their own this. They inherit this from the surrounding scope. This is great for callbacks and React, but it can mess you up if youâ€™re using it in object methods or constructors.

    const obj = {
      name: "Raj",
      greet: () => {
        console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name}`); // Uh-oh, this.name is undefined
      }
    };

    obj.greet();

    const obj1 = {
      name: "Raj",
      greet: function () {
        console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name}`); // Boom! "Hi, I'm Raj"
      }
    };

    obj1.greet();
